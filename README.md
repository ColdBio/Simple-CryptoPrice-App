# Simple-CryptoPrice-App
This app was solely made to that I can improve myself and gain a better understanding of what making a simple app entails. If you wish for whatever reason to fork and use this respository, I'm more than happy for that, but please use your own API keys where applicable.
- This simple app lists the top 100 coins from the Coingecko-API and displays it in a scrollable list. 
- This repository is undercontruction

## What's New
- Added a new tab for crypto related news
- Added a new tab that shows the Top 100 exchanges and their 24 hour BTC trading volume normalised
